# Closed-loop stimulation experiments
Scripts and analysis for closed loop mouse and electrical stimulation. Each folder is for a specific dataset or experiment.

- Patterns-5K is a dataset of 5,000 10-step electrical patterns with 3 uA current and varying pulse shapes, with electrical write-in and read-out. 
- One_stim_channel is data for an experiment where one of 10 electrodes was stimulated with 3, 4, or 5 uA current, with electrical write-in and optical calcium fluorescence output. 
- Closed_stim MATLAB is a set of Matlab scripts using Ripple API for simultaneous electrical readout and stimulation based on the readout.
